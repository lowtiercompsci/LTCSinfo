This code is entirely untested and is in the very early indev stages.

The lack of testing stems from various issues with me being unable to make the dotNET SDK and work properly with VS Code for some reason that not even I know of.

Anyways, without me making up more excuses. LTCSinfo is a very basic program meant to display the information of a computer in the command panel.
It is designed for Windows and should work with Windows 11 (untested), and presumably (untested) Windows 10. It's main purpose is to be relatively lightweight (versions in other languages such as C++, and even Javascript will be made to make it better at this)
but most importantly open source and modifyable to make it better. More so acting as a base for other better programs. It's entirely open for use by anyone
EXCEPT if you want to commercialize it.

As previously mentioned, the code remains untested. This is what I call LTCSinfo_v0.1.0 or LTCSinfo Alpha as it is very much in early development
and literally the most basic version for now.
